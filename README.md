Simple phonebook web application that works in browser. User can add contacts(name and number), delete and edit them. The contacts are listed in the website and the data is stored in mongodb.

Coded with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node

Also did a build version of the app using fly but decided not to keep this running.

To try this project on your own computer follow these instructions:


Add .env file to the backend folder where you setup your mongodb connection
run "npm install" in both frontend folder and backend folder in your terminal/console

To run it:
First start the backend and make sure it connects correctly to your mongodb
To start the backend run "npm start" while in backend folder in terminal
Then open new terminal window and go to frontend folder and run "npm start"
